This is a test for me to try out all the git commands.  Hope everything will work fine!

u - undo last change
$ - go to the end of the line
a - append after cursor
o - open a new line after current line
A - append after the line
G - move to the last line of the file

h - move left
l - move right 
j - move up
k - move down

x - delete character to the right of cursor
D - delete to the end of the line

This is a redundant line to be deleted!
